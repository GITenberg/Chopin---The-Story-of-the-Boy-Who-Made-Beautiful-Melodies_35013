<p>Enclosed in this envelope is the cord and the
needle with which to bind this book. Start in from
the outside as shown on the diagram here. Pass the
needle and thread through the center of the book,
leaving an end extend outside, then through to the
outside, about 2 inches from the center; then from
the outside to inside 2 inches from the center at the
other end of the book, bringing the thread finally
again through the center, and tie the two ends in a
knot, one each side of the cord on the outside.</p>

<p class="h2">HOW TO USE THIS BOOK</p>

<hr />

<p class="noindent">THIS book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN
BOOK OF GREAT MUSICIANS, written by Thomas
Tapper, author of "Pictures from the Lives of the Great Composers
for Children," "Music Talks with Children," "First
Studies in Music Biography," and others.</p>

<p>The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut
apart by the child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its
proper place throughout the book, pasted in the space containing
the same number as will be found under each picture on the
sheet. It is not necessary to cover the entire back of a picture
with paste. Put it only on the corners and place neatly within
the lines you will find printed around each space. Use photographic
paste, if possible.</p>

<p>After this play-work is completed there will be found at
the back of the book blank pages upon which the child is to
write his own story of the great musician, based upon the facts
and questions found on the previous pages.</p>

<p>The book is then to be sewed by the child through the
center with the cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book
thus becomes the child's own book.</p>

<p>This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and
interesting task for the children, but will teach them the main
facts with regard to the life of each of the great musicians&mdash;an
educational feature worth while.</p>

<hr />

<p>This series of the Child's Own Book of Great Musicians
includes at present a book on each of the following:</p>

<p class="h2">The Story of the Boy who Made<br />
Beautiful Melodies</p>

<p>As long as we live and keep in touch with the
works of the great composers we shall love more and
more the music of Frederic François Chopin.</p>

<p>It will be pleasant to learn from time to time
something about him. We should like, for example,
to know:</p>

<p>In what country he was born.</p>

<p>In what places he lived.</p>

<p>What kinds of music he composed.</p>

<p>Perhaps we may begin by learning that he was
born in a little village in Poland not far from the City
of Warsaw, beside which flows the famous river
Vistula. Here is a picture of the house in which
Chopin was born.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 685px;">
<img src="images/illus02.png" width="685" height="400" alt="No. 2" title="No. 2" />
<span class="caption">CHOPIN&#39;S BIRTHPLACE</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>Chopin's father, a Frenchman by birth, was a
schoolmaster. (So was the father of Franz Schubert,
you remember.) The boy's mother was a native of
Poland. From the time when he was a little boy, the
future great composer loved his mother's country and
the people just as much as he loved the dear mother
herself.</p>

<p>The father knew that his little son was musical,
so he took the greatest care to have him taught by the
best teachers. He watched over him quite as Leopold
Mozart watched the progress of Wolferl; and as Mendelssohn's
mother guided Felix and Fanny in their
first music lessons.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn and Chopin were indeed very nearly
the same age. Mendelssohn was born in February,
1809, and Chopin was
born the first of March in
the same year. Let us
keep their names together
in our memory for the future.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn died two
years before the death of
Chopin. Both of these
great composers kept
busily at their work until
the last year of their lives
although neither of them
was very strong.</p>

<span class="caption">F. MENDELSSOHN</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>
Here is a picture of little Chopin playing for a
group of boyhood friends.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 611px;">
<img src="images/illus04.png" width="611" height="400" alt="No. 4" title="No. 4" />
<span class="caption">LITTLE CHOPIN PLAYING FOR HIS FRIENDS</span>
</div>

<p>Chopin was only nine years old when he first
played in public. It is said that he created quite a sensation.
But like all those who know that talent is
something to be worked for, he did not stop studying
just because his playing was pleasing to other people.
In fact, it was just on that account that he began to
work all the harder.</p>

<p>Then there came a great change. He left his home
and went to Paris, where he lived for the rest of his
life. Even though he was but a youth of twenty-one,
he had already composed two concertos for the piano.
These he had played in public to the great delight of
all who heard him, but especially of his countrymen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;6]</span>
You see, Chopin's going to Paris was a strange
journey. The boy was leaving his mother's country
and going to the land of his father. Like Joseph
Haydn, who went away at the age of six, Chopin
never lived at home again.</p>

<p>But he did not reach Paris a stranger. The world
of music had heard of him and some of its great ones
welcomed his coming.</p>

<p>Let us always think of these men who knew each
other well as a family.</p>

<span class="caption">CHOPIN</span>
</div>

<p>Liszt was a great pianist.</p>

<p>Berlioz was a famous composer for the orchestra.</p>

<p>Meyerbeer was best known as an operatic composer.</p>

<p>Heine was a great poet whose verses were set to
music by many song composers.</p>

<p>Berlioz was the only
one of the group who was born in France.</p>

<p>During his boyhood Chopin played much in public,
journeying to some of the great cities of Europe,
among them Vienna, Berlin, and Munich.</p>

<p>Therefore, when he played in Paris it was as an
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;7]</span>
artist. Here, as at home, he charmed everyone by the
beauty of his music and the loveliness of his touch.</p>

<p>He possessed the true piano hand. It was somewhat
narrow. The fingers were long and tapering.
It seemed at once strong and vigorous, yet delicate
and sensitive.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 618px;">
<img src="images/illus10.png" width="618" height="400" alt="No. 10" title="No. 10" />
<span class="caption">CHOPIN&#39;S HAND</span>
</div>

<p>Indeed, Chopin's music is of just these qualities.
It is strong in its nobility, delicate in its sentiment.</p>

<p>One would think that to arrive in Paris and to be
welcomed by the great ones would make everything
easy.</p>

<p>But it was not so for Chopin. Only a few people
were present at his first concert and for quite a while
he had no pupils.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was all so discouraging that he made
up his mind to return to his beloved Poland.</p>

<p>His friend, Franz Liszt, begged him not to go.
Others, too, urged him to stay in Paris. One friend,
who met him in the street as he was about to leave,
advised him as did the others to stay in Paris.</p>

<p>But no, he was going home.</p>

<p>"But," said this friend, "first come with me to visit
a true lover of music."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
So Chopin went with him to the house of Baron
Rothschild. Here he played, so charming the company
with his music that ever so many of them begged
him for the privilege of lessons.</p>

<p>And so, all in a moment, his troubles blew away,
as troubles often do. Here is a picture of Chopin
playing in the home of a prince.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 676px;">
<img src="images/illus11.png" width="676" height="400" alt="No. 11" title="No. 11" />
<span class="caption">CHOPIN PLAYING FOR THE PRINCE</span>
</div>

<p>Do you wonder what kind of a man the little
Polish boy became after he found success in Paris?</p>

<p>One person said about him:</p>

<p>"Chopin talks little, and rarely about music. But
when he does speak of music one must listen to him."</p>

<p>Another said:</p>

<p>"He is reserved and quiet, especially among
strangers, but among his friends he is witty and full
of sly humor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
But his thoughts were not for words, they did not
weave the pretty phrases of idle talk. They were busy
making nocturnes, waltzes, mazurkas, impromptus
and many other kinds of music that we shall learn to
love as we hear them.</p>

<p>Music was Chopin's true speech. The world soon
learned to love what he said in it. And it always will
love it.</p>

<p>See how beautifully he wrote his music.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus12.png" width="700" height="354" alt="No. 12" title="No. 12" />
<span class="caption">CHOPIN&#39;S AUTOGRAPH <a href="music/chopin.mid">Listen</a></span>
</div>

<p>There was neither telephone nor telegraph in
those days. Yet it did not take long for another composer,
Robert Schumann, who lived far away, in Germany,
to learn that a genius by the name of Chopin
lived in Paris.</p>

<p>The post carried to Schumann a copy of Chopin's
first printed music. This was a theme taken from
Mozart's Opera <i>Don Juan</i>, which Chopin arranged
with variations for the piano.</p>

<p>When Schumann played it to his friends everyone
exclaimed: "How beautiful it is!"</p>

<p>Then someone said:</p>

<p>"Chopin&mdash;I never heard the name. Who can
he be?"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">R. SCHUMANN</span>
</div>

<p>So we see that his
thoughts printed as music
flew like winged messengers
to carry news of him
to others in distant places.
And people not merely
asked: "Who can he be?"
but they found out who he
was, and kept passing the
news on and on until
finally it has reached
us!</p>

<p>Chopin was never a robust person, though he was
well and busy most of his life. But in the last years
he suffered much from illness. This led him to travel
to many places from
Paris for the good of
his health.</p>

<p>Chopin was devoted
to Poland, the beloved
land of his birth. Here
is a picture of the great
composer who has fallen
asleep at the keyboard
and is dreaming
of a glorious future for
Poland.</p>

<span class="caption">CHOPIN DREAMING OF POLAND</span>
</div>

<p>Once he went to
England and to Scotland.
He played in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
London and was highly praised for the beautiful way
he performed his own music.</p>

<p>While it is true that Chopin was ill in the last
years of his life, we must notice that he kept right on
with his work. He played and composed just as he
always had done. Chopin died in Paris, October 17,
1849, just two years after Mendelssohn, who died in
1847.</p>

<p>Many men, who would have given up everything
had they not been brave, have worked right on
through illness.</p>

<p>Milton was blind, but he dictated <i>Paradise Lost</i> to
his daughter.</p>

<p>Beethoven was deaf, but he did not give up composing.</p>

<p>Robert Louis Stevenson, who wrote the lovely
<i>Child's Garden of Verses</i>, was ill all his life, but he
kept on writing. Grieg was probably never well all
his life, but he never gave up.</p>

<p>Have you ever thought that the beautiful ideas of
great men sometimes outlive famous cities?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;12]</span>
What a lot of cities and countries we must visit
in our thoughts, to see the great composers at their
work. For example&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Grieg belongs to Norway.</p>

<p>2. Chopin to Warsaw and Paris.</p>

<p>3. Schubert to Vienna in Austria.</p>

<p>4. Bach to Thuringia in Saxony, Germany.</p>

<p>5. Handel to Germany and England.</p>

<p>6. Haydn to Hungary.</p>

<p>7. Beethoven to Germany and Vienna. (He was
born at Bonn on the Rhine).</p>

<p>8. Schumann to Germany.</p>

<p>9. Mendelssohn to Hamburg and Berlin, Germany.</p>

<p>10. Mozart to Salzburg and Vienna in Austria.</p>

<p>It will be a pleasant thing for us to see if we can
arrange these names in order, beginning with the
oldest, Bach and Handel, and coming down to the
latest. By doing such things, time and time again,
they begin to stick in the memory.</p>


<p class="h3">SOME FACTS ABOUT CHOPIN</p>

<p>When you have read this page and the next make
a story about Chopin's life. Write it in your own
words. When you are quite sure you cannot improve
it, copy it on pages 15 and 16.</p>

<p>1. Frederic François Chopin was born in Poland.</p>

<p>2. His birthday was March 1, 1809.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;13]</span>
3. He spent most of his life in the two cities of
Warsaw and Paris.</p>

<p>4. His father was French; his mother Polish.</p>

<p>5. At the age of nine he made his first public appearance
as a pianist.</p>

<p>6. Many distinguished people welcomed him to
Paris.</p>

<p>7. Among them were Liszt, Berlioz, Meyerbeer,

<p>9. This tempted him to return to Poland.</p>

<p>10. But his friends urged him to remain in Paris.</p>

<p>11. Finally success came.</p>

<p>12. Chopin was described as one who spoke little,

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
